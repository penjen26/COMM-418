I am very interested in the second chart in the article – the one on defensive-minded head coaches who won the Super Bowl. The point is that the Seahawks’ head coach calls most of their plays on defense, and it’s been a little while since a defense-focused coach won the Super Bowl. The author compares this to coaches he determines to be “defensive-minded.” I want more details here. Are these just coaches who were defensive coordinators before becoming head coaches? That seems to be true for at least most of them, but I think he needs to say that out right. He also lists the final scores of each of those games but doesn’t elaborate on what it means. I assume it’s to show potentially lower scoring games because it’s a defense-focused mind calling the winning plays, but he should explain how that compares to the games won by offense-focused coaches, or how this applies to this year’s matchup. And besides the most recent example of 13-3 in 2018, these games don’t seem particularly low scoring, but I have no basis to compare this too. I think it’s a good idea for a data story but it is poorly executed.
