To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:
All expense reports related to Gov. Mikie Sherrill's inaugural ball at the American Dream Mall on Jan. 20, 2026.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,

Penelope Jennings
