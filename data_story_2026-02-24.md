The Athletic invented metrics to assess the success of NFL coaches. I think it's fun when sports people try to create new statistics to figure out how good someone or something is doing. Baseball embraced more advanced statistics a while ago, and most other sports are further behind. The news peg is that almost a third of teams will have new coaches next year, and so fans are either looking forward to success or may be reflecting on the tenures of their old coaches. The Athletic created averages from the tenures of the 160 coaching hires made between 2000 and 2022. They then awarded coaches points for surpassing each of the six averages, giving the most successful six points. This assessment leaves Bill Belichick as one of the most successful hires, which should confirm that they're doing something right. I honestly think anyone who successfully leads their team to a Super Bowl win is a good hire, but I appreciate the other metrics they're using. Sports fans will have the same argument about trades -- was a trade good, which team won the trade, etc -- but if one of the teams wins the championship with that traded player, they've won the trade. This certainly isn't perfect because a really good coach can only do so much if the 53 guys on the actual team are bad, but it's an interesting thing to think about. The data is all out there. They don't credit any specific source, I imagine because it's just NFL performance data that exists everywhere but I'd assume they looked at something like Pro Football Reference. It is a little weird to not credit anyone at all, they have to have actually looked somewhere for the numbers. The analysis is imperfect, but it has generated 150 comments, a lot of which are suggesting changes, and getting people involved in your analysis seems like another mark of a successful article.
