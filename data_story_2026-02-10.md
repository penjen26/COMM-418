This is a super cool interactive map made by The Washington Post showing where winter Olympic sports facilities in the U.S. are. The first map shows concentrations and also labels the previous U.S. Winter Olympic hosts. I like how the interactive is personalizable to basically any town in the country, and you can see which sports you could (theoretically) try within an hour of where you live. I think this story points out the inaccessibility of a lot of these sports. Almost all of the “sliding sport” facilities are located at previous Olympic host sites. I also like that the article remembers the town I input before and pins it on the ski jumping map. They scale the map of Olympians in each state to Olympians per 1 million residents which is neat. It shows how New England states, particularly Vermont, really punch above their weight, population-wise. The data was collected from the national governing bodies for the Winter Olympic sports. One way to make this more interesting would be to do something similar for the Summer Games, and compare the population distributions of Olympians. Sports like track are so much more accessible since running surfaces are abundant, compared to skiing’s requirement for literal mountains that just don’t exist in a lot of states. It could also be interesting to compare the facilities we have to those in the top countries in each sport – like how far does the average Norwegian live from ski mountains? What’s the distribution of curling rinks in Canada? The data is presented through maps primarily, but is also explained in words. I think the story feels conversational and explanatory in a way that really works.
