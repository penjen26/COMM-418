This is a New York Times article showing how Congress has pushed back on many of Trump’s proposed cuts. The data is said to be from the Senate Appropriations Committee Democrats. There is a chart high up in the story that has the key data for the story – it displays Trump’s proposed cuts to each department and what Congress actually enacted. The agencies are organized with the proposed largest cuts at the top, and the largest proposed increases at the bottom. The bars are clearly labeled so it is clear which agency is which, but a few are abbreviated and I will be honest I did not know what the SBA is. I assume most of the Times’ readership knows most of the agencies by their three letters. The second column looks kind of haphazard, but that’s just because Congress’ decisions don’t match up on the same scale as Trump’s proposed cuts. I think the main point communicated here is that Trump wanted widescale large cuts and Congress just didn’t act that extremely. I think this story is here to counter certain narratives that Trump has just taken a machete to the government, which he’s tried to do, but Congress has stopped some of it. The story could be updated if a mentioned 12th appropriations bill passes. The congressional sources are all Democrats which could raise some eyebrows, but they state in the story that Republicans didn’t respond to requests for comment so they were given a chance to weigh in. It’s only really brought up at the end, but an interesting point is raised at the end – a number of the Republicans involved are worried about how their votes impact reelection.
