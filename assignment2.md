This story first uses data to prove just how historically bad Indiana University football is. The team had a .384 winning percentage in the 25 years before this season, the worst of any national champion. All of the data is cited as coming from Sports Reference. The first chart is a scatterplot which shows every single national champion’s winning percentage in the 25 years preceding their title, plus 2025 Indiana and Miami. This shows how bad Indiana is compared to all of them, while the next bar chart shows how far Indiana is from the next worst, and shows how long ago those other bad teams played. There’s a continued series of charts that set out to prove how much of an aberration this year’s Indiana football team is. This story does exactly what it says it will in the headline: it is “Seven charts that show Indiana’s historic path from doormat to dominance.” I like how the team is shown to be an anomaly on the scale of all of college football history and also just within the history of the program. A variety of charts is used and I like how they choose different styles for different datasets. This story was published Monday morning before Indiana actually won so I would do a followup either affirming the points made here, or with some sort of specific analysis of the game or their whole playoff run because they won pretty dominantly. There’s an average margin of victory chart for Indiana’s program history, but I wonder how their average playoff margin of victory compares to other national champions. I would assume it wouldn’t be as much of an outlier in that category. I like sports but don’t really follow college football and I’ve heard about how historically bad Indiana is but didn’t know the full extent so I appreciate this story for laying out all the ways this team is unique.
