I think the most interesting thing about our class data is the overall unfamiliarity with coding languages shown. I think our professor's answers should be disregarded for this purpose as one would hope the instructor of a data journalism course knows more about coding than the students. We're mostly pretty familiar with FOIA and Sheets/Excel but there's a steep dropoff with all of the other specific knowledge questions besides the statistical methods of data analysis. Almost all of us also prefer written journalism and would rather confront 100 duck-sized horses.
