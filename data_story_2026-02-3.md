This is a data story because it’s based on misappropriated funds and the specific dollar amounts used for other purposes. They also state that they got this information from FOIA. I assume they requested expense reports from the company through the D.C. government because they were contracted by the government? The data is less so the focus here — the sheer number of funds isn’t the main story, it’s the fact that the D.C. government wound up paying for things they shouldn’t have in the name of violence prevention. The data backs up the story, showing the magnitude of bad spending. They use the figure of “more than $400,000” in the subhead. The third paragraph is the most interesting one, data wise: “The D.C. government awarded Life Deeds $3.6 million in violence prevention grants over the course of 15 months from October 2023 through December 2024. The group used more than $411,000 of that money to hire businesses owned by or linked to its own employees or their family members, according to a Post review of thousands of pages of financial records for Life Deeds.” This paragraph gets at the big point of the story — they used a large portion of the money they were given to fund their own family members’ businesses. I think this is well constructed because of the specific figures, and how it poses them in relation to each other.
